### Multithreaded Parallel Season Simulation — season_runner

- `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` threads, each running independent season batches
- Thread-local result containers merged after `join()` — no mutex on hot path
- Seed isolation: thread `t` uses base `42 + t × 100000`, incrementing per game
- `Makefile`: `-O3 -march=native -pthread` for season target

### Fast Mode — BallPhysicsEngine / GameEngine

- `BallPhysicsEngine::simulate(input, ballpark, fastMode)` — skips trajectory recording in fast mode
- `GameEngine::setFastMode(bool)` — propagates to physics engine for season simulation

### Change-of-Direction Penalty Improvements — PlayResolutionEngine

- **Outfielder diagonal routes**: `lateralBonus = |dxNorm| × 0.15` added to over-the-head penalty (0.44 max)
- **Infielder arm-side range**: SS/3B ranging to catcher's right (or 2B/1B to left) gets `+0.04–0.10s` penalty when `armDot > 0.50`

### SSW Batted Ball — ContactEngine

- `gyroFraction = (1 − activeSpin) × |spinAxisY|` computed at contact
- `sideSpin += gyroFraction × 4.5 × rand(−1, 1)` — seam-shift wake perturbs lateral batted-ball spin
- Cutter/slider affected most; 4-seam almost none

### RISP Situational AI — GameEngine formedBatter

- When runner on 2B or 3B: `eye +1`, `contact +1` before each at-bat
- Minor plate discipline boost with runners in scoring position

### SB% Calibration — GameEngine checkStolenBase

- 1B→2B attempt rate `0.044 → 0.066`, success `0.73 → 0.79`
- 2B→3B attempt rate `0.022 → 0.033`, success `0.67 → 0.73`
- Double steal lead runner success `0.67 → 0.73`, trail `0.75 → 0.81`

### groundBallOutProb Calibration — PlayResolutionEngine

- Zone base rates raised: `0.82/0.76/0.68/0.58/0.44 → 0.85/0.79/0.71/0.60/0.45`

### Per-Game Weather Randomization — season_runner

- Each game: temperature ±10°F around park baseline (clamped 45–95°F)
- Wind speed: 0–8 mph; direction: 0–360° random; season-seeded for reproducibility

### Team Rebalance — Teams.cpp

- **South Philly Stallions**: all 8 batters `contact/power/speed +4–6`
- **Fairmount Rams**: all 8 batters `contact/power/speed +2–4`
- **Germantown Colonials**: all 8 batters `contact/power/speed +2–3`

## v2.1 - Full Calibration: K%, BABIP, RS/G, SBA/G (2026-06-23)

**Confirmed metrics (100-season average):**

| Metric | v2.0 → v2.1 | MLB ref |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| K% | 24.2% → 22.9% | 22-23% ✓ |
| BB% | ~9% | ~9% ✓ |
| BABIP | 0.316 → 0.300 | ~0.300 ✅ |
| SBA/G | 0.66 → ~1.0 | ~1.0 ✅ |
| Staten Island RS/G | 2.98 → 3.49 | — |
| Fairmount RS/G | 2.85 → 3.22 | — |
| South Philly RS/G | 2.83 → 3.12 | — |

### K% Calibration (multi-round) — ContactEngine

- contactChance base raised from `0.84 → 0.87` over 3 rounds
- `stuff` coefficient `0.11 → 0.07`, `pitchQuality` `0.11 → 0.07` (triple-lever approach)
- `timingQuality` weight `0.17 → 0.14`
- Result: K% converged at 22.9% (MLB 2024 actual: 22.7%)

### BABIP Calibration — PlayResolutionEngine groundBallOutProb

- Zone base rates tuned over 2 rounds: `0.80/0.74/0.66/0.56/0.42 → 0.83/0.77/0.69/0.58/0.44`
- Inner 3 zones raised to route more grounders to fielders and reduce bloop rate

### RS/G Balancing — Teams

- **Staten Island Foxes**: all 8 lineup batters `contact/power/eye +4–6`; ace Ben Mack `vel/ctrl/stuff +2`
- **Fairmount Rams**: all 8 lineup batters `+6` across the board
- **South Philly Stallions**: all 8 lineup batters `+4–6` across the board

### SBA/G Calibration — GameEngine checkStolenBase

- Attempt multipliers ×1.5: double steal `0.026→0.039`, 1B→2B `0.044→0.066`, 2B→3B `0.022→0.033`

## v2.0 - Ground Ball Rolling Fix + horizontalBatError Redesign (2026-06-22)

**Entering state (from v1.9):** K%=26%, BB%=8.7%, BABIP=0.473, RS/G=3.91–5.22  
**Exiting state:** K%=24.2%, BABIP=0.316, RS/G recalibrated  

### candidateFix — Ground Ball Rolling (PlayResolutionEngine)

- **Root cause:** `groundCandidateIndices` used `landingPoint` distance. Very-negative-LA balls (LA −4° to 0°) land at 10–30 ft → assigned to Catcher/Pitcher only → both excluded by depth filter → auto-hit. ~20–25% of BIP.
- **Fix:** `d = max(landDist, min(restDist, 174.0))` — uses `finalRestPoint` so slow rollers are correctly assigned to SS/2B/3B/1B.
- **Recalibration required:** candidateFix converted ~25% of auto-hits to proper fielding; `groundBallOutProb` zones recalibrated to restore target BABIP.

### horizontalBatError Redesign — ContactEngine

- **Problem:** `timingError × 2.2 → horizontalBatError → barrelAccuracy` coupling forced K% floor at ~25–26%. Reducing timingError to lower K% also improved barrelAccuracy → RS/G rose.
- **Fix:** `horizontalBatError = timingError × 0.6 + batTracking(contact)` where `batTracking = rand(−0.24, 0.24) × (1 − contact × 0.42)`.
- **Effect:** K%/contactQuality decoupled. K% dropped from 26% to 24.2% without RS/G spike.

### 3D Pitch Spin Axis — PitchEngine

- `Pitch` struct gains `spinAxisX/Y/Z` (unit vector), `spinRate`, `activeSpin` per pitch
- Per pitch type: 4-seam FB axis `(−0.97, 0, ±0.26)`, curveball `(+0.97, 0, ∓0.26)`, slider `(0.25, 0, ±0.97)`, cutter `(0.60, 0, ±0.80)`, etc.
- `activeSpin`: 4-seam 0.93, cutter 0.50, slider 0.35, splitter 0.25
- `armDrag = (55 − pitchingControl) / 60` — low-control pitchers have more natural tail/sink
- spinAxisY (gyro component) now varies by pitch type and control, enabling SSW batted ball

## v1.9 - ERA Spread + BABIP Reduction (2026-06-22)

**Confirmed metrics (100-season average):**

| Metric | Value | MLB ref |
|--------|-------|---------|
| K% | 26.0% | 22-23% |
| BB% | 8.7% | 9% |
| BABIP | 0.473 | 0.300* |
| RS/G | 3.91–5.22 | 4.0–5.0 ✓ |
| ERA (individual) | 2.81–6.51 | — |
| Team PCT range | .305–.637 | — |

*BABIP 0.300 is real MLB; our 0.473 floor is structural (see PHYSICS_ROADMAP.md).

### ERA Spread — PitchEngine + Teams

- `PitchEngine`: pitchQuality & commandSpread coefficients raised `0.18 → 0.26`
- `ContactEngine`: stuff/pitchQuality influence on contactChance raised `0.09 → 0.14`
- `Teams.cpp`: pitcher stat range widened
  - Cole Maddox (ace): velocity/control/stuff `84/72/82 → 88/76/86`
  - Ben Mack (weak starter): control/stuff `64/67 → 52/60`
  - Victor Hale: control `56 → 46` (wild power pitcher)
  - All closers and bullpens rescaled to match team tier

### BABIP Reduction — Bimodal BIP Model

- `ContactEngine`: good contact flyRate `0–38% → 0–65%`, LA `30–44° → 33–50°`
- Bloop model in `PlayResolutionEngine`: extended coverage `193ft → 218ft`
- `ZoneJudge`: umpire xLimit `0.79 → 0.73` (narrower zone → BB%↑)
- `protectBonus`: `0.20 → 0.13` (2-strike protection reduced)

### Structural Limits Identified

**K% floor ~25–26%** and **BABIP floor ~0.470** share the same root:
`timingError → horizontalBatError → barrelAccuracy → contactQuality`
Any change that reduces K% (tighter timingError, lower locationError) simultaneously improves contactQuality → RS/G rises. True decoupling requires redesigning `horizontalBatError` to not scale with `timingError`. Next fix path: ground ball rolling model (see PHYSICS_ROADMAP.md § Ground Ball Rolling).

## v1.8 - Bimodal BIP + Player Spread (2026-06-21)

- Bimodal BIP shaping (ContactEngine): 3-tier system by contactQuality
  - poor (cq < 0.45): grounder-dominant
  - medium (0.45–0.62): mixed with moderate GB rate
  - good (cq > 0.62): elevated fly or hard line drive
- Player spread: `contact*0.30`, `power*0.13`, `timingError contact*0.050`
- RS/G recalibrated to MLB range via contactChance base adjustment

- Added `app/analysis_runner.cpp` for focused balance verification.
- Added analysis Makefile targets:
  - `make -C app analysis`
  - `make -C app analysis-run`
- Added analysis modes:
  - `100-games`
  - `100-seasons`
  - `1000-seasons`
- Analysis output includes league averages, team records, run environment, hitting rates, and runner metrics.

## v1.0 - Fixed Balance

- Finalized core simulation balance for league and season runners.
- Confirmed team identity differences, including Bronx speed-based runner value.
- Finalized runner metrics:
  - `XBT/G`: Extra base taken per game.
  - `TOH/G`: Times out at home per game.
  - `SF%`: Sacrifice fly success rate.
  - `H-OFA/G`: Home outfield assists per game.
- Hid `OOB/G` from public runner output while keeping internal tracking for future baserunning expansion.
- Confirmed build targets:
  - `JojiLeagueRunner`
  - `JojiSeasonRunner`

## v1.0 Runner Metric Definitions

- `XBT/G`: Extra base taken per game. Measures aggressive advancement on hits.
- `TOH/G`: Times out at home per game. Measures runners thrown out trying to score.
- `SF%`: Sacrifice fly success rate.
- `H-OFA/G`: Home outfield assists per game. Measures outfield throws that result in outs at home.
- `OOB/G`: Outs on bases per game. Tracked internally but hidden in v1.0 because current runner outs are mostly home-plate outs.
